     * to tell the library that this DNSServiceRef is not a typical uninitialized DNSServiceRef;
     * it's a copy of an existing DNSServiceRef whose connection information should be reused.

     * Also see Point 4.(Don't Double-Deallocate if the MainRef has been Deallocated) in Notes below:
     *
     * Notes:
     *
     * 1. Collective kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing flag
     * When callbacks are invoked using a shared DNSServiceRef, the
     * kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing flag applies collectively to *all* active
     * operations sharing the same parent DNSServiceRef. If the MoreComing flag is
     * set it means that there are more results queued on this parent DNSServiceRef,
     * but not necessarily more results for this particular callback function.
     * The implication of this for client programmers is that when a callback
     * is invoked with the MoreComing flag set, the code should update its
     * internal data structures with the new result, and set a variable indicating
     * that its UI needs to be updated. Then, later when a callback is eventually
     * invoked with the MoreComing flag not set, the code should update *all*
     * stale UI elements related to that shared parent DNSServiceRef that need
     * updating, not just the UI elements related to the particular callback
     * that happened to be the last one to be invoked.
     *
     * 2. Canceling operations and kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing
     * Whenever you cancel any operation for which you had deferred UI updates
     * waiting because of a kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing flag, you should perform
     * those deferred UI updates. This is because, after cancelling the operation,
     * you can no longer wait for a callback *without* MoreComing set, to tell
     * you do perform your deferred UI updates (the operation has been canceled,
     * so there will be no more callbacks). An implication of the collective
     * kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing flag for shared connections is that this
     * guideline applies more broadly -- any time you cancel an operation on
     * a shared connection, you should perform all deferred UI updates for all
     * operations sharing that connection. This is because the MoreComing flag
     * might have been referring to events coming for the operation you canceled,
     * which will now not be coming because the operation has been canceled.
     *
     * 3. Only share DNSServiceRef's created with DNSServiceCreateConnection
     * Calling DNSServiceCreateConnection(&ref) creates a special shareable DNSServiceRef.
     * DNSServiceRef's created by other calls like DNSServiceBrowse() or DNSServiceResolve()
     * cannot be shared by copying them and using kDNSServiceFlagsShareConnection.
     *
     * 4. Don't Double-Deallocate if the MainRef has been Deallocated
     * Calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate(ref) for a particular operation's DNSServiceRef terminates
     * just that operation. Calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate(ref) for the main shared DNSServiceRef
     * (the parent DNSServiceRef, originally created by DNSServiceCreateConnection(&ref))
     * automatically terminates the shared connection and all operations that were still using it.
     * After doing this, DO NOT then attempt to deallocate any remaining subordinate DNSServiceRef's.
     * The memory used by those subordinate DNSServiceRef's has already been freed, so any attempt
     * to do a DNSServiceRefDeallocate (or any other operation) on them will result in accesses
     * to freed memory, leading to crashes or other equally undesirable results.
     *
     * 5. Thread Safety
     * The dns_sd.h API does not presuppose any particular threading model, and consequently
     * does no locking internally (which would require linking with a specific threading library).
     * If the client concurrently, from multiple threads (or contexts), calls API routines using 
     * the same DNSServiceRef, it is the client's responsibility to provide mutual exclusion for 
     * that DNSServiceRef.

     * For example, use of DNSServiceRefDeallocate requires caution. A common mistake is as follows:
     * Thread B calls DNSServiceRefDeallocate to deallocate sdRef while Thread A is processing events
     * using sdRef. Doing this will lead to intermittent crashes on thread A if the sdRef is used after
     * it was deallocated.

     * A telltale sign of this crash type is to see DNSServiceProcessResult on the stack preceding the
     * actual crash location.

     * To state this more explicitly, mDNSResponder does not queue DNSServiceRefDeallocate so
     * that it occurs discretely before or after an event is handled.
